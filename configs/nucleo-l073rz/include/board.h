 * logic on the board and are not available for software control:
 *
 * LD1 COM:  LD1 default status is red.  LD1 turns to green to indicate that
 *           communications are in progress between the PC and the
 *           ST-LINK/V2-1.
 * LD3 PWR:  red LED indicates that the board is powered.
 *
 * And one can be controlled by software:
 *
 * User LD2: green LED is a user LED connected to the I/O PA5 of the
 *           STM32LO73RZ.
 *
 * If CONFIG_ARCH_LEDS is not defined, then the user can control the LED in
 * any way.  The following definition is used to access the LED.
